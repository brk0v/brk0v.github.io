This process of resolution is one of the oldest forms of networking abstraction, designed to replace hard-to-remember network addresses with human-readable strings. Although it may seem simple at first glance, the entire process involving stub resolvers is filled with complexities and subtle nuances.</description></item><item><title>What is a stub resolver?</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/1-what-is-a-stub-resolver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/1-what-is-a-stub-resolver/</guid><description>1. What is a stub resolver? # First of all, let’s shed some light on what a stub resolver is.
Whenever someone begins talking about hostname resolution issues or nameserver changes, the first thing most people think of is the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file. Indeed, /etc/resolv.conf is a core and fundamental part of the local resolver system, and we will discuss it in detail later in this series, including how it’s managed on modern GNU/Linux distributions with systemd.</description></item><item><title>History: gethostbyname() and old good friends</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/2-history-gethostbyname/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/2-history-gethostbyname/</guid><description>2. History: gethostbyname() and old good friends # Please do not use any of the code snippets from this chapter in your projects. They are provided solely for historical and educational purposes. Instead, you should use getaddrinfo(). The gethostbyname (man 3 gethostbyname) function first appeared in the 1980s and has been a part of the networking landscape ever since. Despite its obsoletion, some programs still use it. It was deprecated in POSIX.</description></item><item><title>getaddrinfo() and POSIX spec</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/3-getaddrinfo-and-posix-spec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/3-getaddrinfo-and-posix-spec/</guid><description>3. getaddrinfo() and POSIX spec # Thus, instead of the deprecated gethostbyname(), getaddrinfo() should be used within libc. The getaddrinfo() function is a POSIX-standardized function and is defined in RFC 3943. It is IP version agnostic and returns data structures that can be easily reused in subsequent socket API calls (such as socket(), connect(), sendto()).
First of all, if you have a codebase that uses gethostbyname() and you are looking to migrate to the modern getaddrinfo(), I have bad news: it’s not a drop-in replacement.</description></item><item><title>getaddrinfo() from glibc</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/4-getaddrinfo-from-glibc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/4-getaddrinfo-from-glibc/</guid><description>4. getaddrinfo() from glibc # The standard in POSIX describes only the behavior and interface of the getaddrinfo() function. However, the actual implementation can vary between different frameworks. In this chapter, we will examine the internals of the getaddrinfo() implementation from glibc version 2.39. In the GNU/Linux world the glibc remains the default C library for the overwhelming majority of systems.
4.1 Internals and design # Even though the main purpose of a stub resolver is to send DNS queries to a recursive server, the reality is more complex than that.</description></item><item><title>getaddrinfo() from musl libc</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/5-getaddrinfo-from-musl-libc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/5-getaddrinfo-from-musl-libc/</guid><description>5. getaddrinfo() from musl libc # musl libc is a lightweight, fast, and simple implementation of the standard C library (libc) that aims for efficiency, standards compliance, and security.
It gained popularity following its extensive use in Alpine Linux, a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution often used as a base image for Docker containers.
However, it is crucial for us to understand that musl libc incorporates a completely new resolver code that behaves differently in certain situations.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Stack applications</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/6-dual-stack-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/6-dual-stack-applications/</guid><description>6. Dual-Stack applications # Let’s now focus on dual-stack programs, which support both IPv4 and IPv6. Here are some critical questions to consider:
For server code:
How can we easily listen on all IPv4 and all IPv6 addresses? Do we need separate listeners for each? Are there any tools or helpers available to manage multiple listeners? For client code:
Which address family should our client program resolve and use: A, AAAA, or both?</description></item><item><title>Async non-blocking resolvers in C</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/7-async-non-blocking-resolvers-in-c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/7-async-non-blocking-resolvers-in-c/</guid><description>7.

The legacy method to handle this complexity was the Resolvconf project. It set up a number of hooks and updated /etc/resolv.conf appropriately by following some defined rules.</description></item><item><title>Querying Nameservers on dual-stack hosts</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/11-querying-nameservers-on-dual-stack-hosts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/11-querying-nameservers-on-dual-stack-hosts/</guid><description>11. Querying Nameservers on dual-stack hosts # The already seen RFC 8305 Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency force the same preference for IPv6 name servers as it does for establishing new connections:
If multiple DNS server addresses are configured for the current network, the client may have the option of sending its DNS queries over IPv4 or IPv6. In keeping with the Happy Eyeballs approach, queries SHOULD be sent over IPv6 first (note that this is not referring to the sending of AAAA or A queries, but rather the address of the DNS server itself and IP version used to transport DNS messages).</description></item><item><title>The Present and the future of resolvers and DNS related features</title><link>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/12-present-and-future-of-resolvers-and-dns-related-features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biriukov.dev/docs/resolver-dual-stack-application/12-present-and-future-of-resolvers-and-dns-related-features/</guid><description>12.
